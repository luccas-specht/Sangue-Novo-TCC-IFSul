# Sangue Novo: Plataform for dynammize contact between donors and blood donation campaigns.

During the end of the Technical Course I took in the Federal Institute, we needed to deliver a final paper and a product in order to conclude the course. I knew it was something that would demand a lot of time during that year, so I thought: 

_"Why not choose a topic that could matter not only to me but also for other people? Why not help people while I'm producing my final paper?"_ 

<!---
That's where the idea of Sangue Novo came from. Alongside with my colleague Lucas Teles, I created an aplication to keep contact with donors collect data so the psychologists could have a clearer view of the disease stage in the periods outside of a therapy session. 

It also creates a viable and simpler way for the teenager to get access to the first step of knowing the disease and getting support to look for a psychology professional.
On the other hand, the psychologist can register keywords they believe are important to each patient treatment. These keywords generate reports for them, so they know when a conversation needs more of their attention and they can know what was happening at that specific time. Ant this time might be even in the middle of the night â€” cause the chatbots never sleep, it is always available for talking to the adolescents and generating a report to the psychologist.
